Python is known to be slow because it is a script language. 
So, I always ask a question to the interviewers who claim to be familiar with Python: Will Python be significantly faster if we compile Python scripts into native codes beforehand? 
The answer is definitively *NO*!
Then, what the hell makes Python run slowly?. 
Please be patient, I will reveal the answer in the following paragraphs.

Let us start with some confusing terms: Python, CPython, and Cython. 
CPython is acctually the most widely used Python implementation. 
When you download a Python interpreter from its homepage, you are downloading a CPython.
CPython compiles your Python code into bytecode and interprets them in an evaluation loop.
That is why we call Python as a script language.

Cython does something more than CPython. 
It maps Python scripts into c codes directly and compiles them into native codes.
The following shows the compilation process of Cython, where the .pyx extension is Cython's version of .py.

```
demo.pyx -> demo.c -> demo.o
```

Here is an example.
We have a simple Python script called demo.py as below.

```python
# demo.py
def demo():
  a = 1
  b = 2
  c = a + b
  return c
```

Then, we compile the script into the c code.
```c
// demo.c
// ...

// ...
```
