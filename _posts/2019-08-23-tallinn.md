I just spent an extradinary Friday in Tallinn, although the weather during the outward voyage is not good. Actually, it is the second time for me to visit Tallinn, but the experience is quite different. Last time, I came with my friends. We visited the Tallinn old town and spent most time walking and shopping, although I had not bought anything. On the contrary, this time is much more comfortable because I am accompanied with my wife. We visited the garden, walked around local markets, and enjoyed western foods, being just like natives.

During our return trip from Tallinn to Helsinki, my wife sang the song I'm Willing (composed by Faye Wong) during the Karaoke session. I am deeply impressed by her bravity for singing a chinese song among a group of finns, as well as the love exuded from the tune and the words.
