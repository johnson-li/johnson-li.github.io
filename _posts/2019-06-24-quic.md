I have worked on QUIC for quite a while, from performance measurements to protocol changes. 
Now, it is the time to take some notes.


## What is QUIC?
QUIC is known as a new transport layer protocol proposed by Google to replace TCP.
It was first implemented in the Chrome browser and revealed publicly in 2013.
Soon after, the design of QUIC was transfered to IETF. 
But Google has not stopped its work on evolving QUIC, while it has promised to adanbon its gQUIC, which stands for the Google's version of QUIC, in the future.

## What is new in QUIC?


## Does QUIC really improves our experience?
