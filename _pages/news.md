## Studying 
I am currently learning **Computer Vision** on [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html). I am still working on the [course project](https://github.com/johnson-li/cs231n).

## Ongoing Projects
As the aim of my current internship, I am trying to improve the performance of [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org). Most recent progresses are shown in the [posts](/categories/#pandas).
